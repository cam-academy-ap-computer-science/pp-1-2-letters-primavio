Good work!  Your program is very clean and well-organized.

So, I guess your program fulfills a strict legalistic reading
of the rules of the assignment... but having all of your letters
be to "friend", and having no closing salutation to your letter,
so that your first letter could be a subset of all the other
letters and they could just call it, doesn't really fit the
intent of the assignment.  On the other hand, it does show that
you understand the concepts.  I'll take off one point.

For future projects, you will want to start adding comments.
